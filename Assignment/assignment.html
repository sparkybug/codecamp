            <p>I love playing Chess and Scrabble. As you can see, I attached screenshots
                of some of wins in the game of Chess. I would have loved to show you screenshots of
                my wins in Scrabblealso but I kinda deleted them few weeks ago...so sorry about that.
            </p>
            <p>I also love solving mathematics in m free and leisure time. Below is
                a picture of one of the stuffs I played around with during the last holiday
                in Trigonometry.

        <h3>Skills Acquired</h3>
            <p>Well, I'm a Graphics Designer. I acquired this skill right after
                I graduated from secondary school. Thanks to my boss, Oluwatobi
                Elijah, I gained useful and valuable knowledge in the field of Graphics for
                a period of 6months which I spent with him at BizLife Technologies. Below are
                some of the projects I've done.
                A logo for two schools, a business card and a logo for another company.
                Check them out..

        <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Being the Geeky Nerd that I am, I would like to be a top notch crazy programmer in the future. I have interests
                in Embedded systems and back-end programming(mehn!, I love this one die..it gives me joy).
                I would also love to be involved in the development of perfect algorithms that would aid quick
                computation in the CS field.
            </p>

        <h3>Dreams</h3>
            <p>One of my dreams is to solve one of the world's greatest problems in CS
                - the N-P completeness problem, using my mathematical and CS skill.
